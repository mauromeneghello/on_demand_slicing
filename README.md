# On_demand_slicing - NetworkingII Activity Project #

## Introduction ##
The goal of this project is to implement a network slicing approach to enable dynamic activation/de-activation of network slices via CLI/GUI commands.

A multi-hop technology is used for this emulation --> there are 11 hosts (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,h7,h8,h9,h10,h11) and 3 switches (s1,s2,s3) in the network:
